This repository is for the code that I wrote during the Learning Tree online Class 
for the "Smells Like Bakin" tutorial.

While I did write the code, it was done while following along with the videos
and I don't have the intention of claiming it as my own or the ideas as my own.

This is my first repository done completely by the command line.
